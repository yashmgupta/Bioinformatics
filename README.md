# Yash's Lab & Bioinformatics Research Unit Website

This repository contains the source code for the official website of **Yash's Lab and Bioinformatics Research Unit**, Department of Biology, Naresuan University.

The website provides an overview of our research focus, particularly in DNA sequence analysis, and showcases the bioinformatics tools and projects developed by our lab.

## :globe_with_meridians: Live Website

You can view the live website hosted on GitHub Pages here:

**[https://yashmgupta.github.io/Bioinformatics/](https://yashmgupta.github.io/Bioinformatics/)**

*(Note: It might take a few minutes for the website to become live after the initial deployment or updates.)*

## :page_facing_up: Website Structure

The website is organized into the following main sections:

*   **Home (`index.html`):** Introduces the lab and its focus on DNA sequence analysis.
*   **Introduction (`introduction.html`):** Provides a detailed overview of bioinformatics and key concepts in DNA sequence analysis like assembly, comparison, gene identification, barcoding, and data representation.
*   **Tools & Projects (`tools.html`):** Showcases the bioinformatics tools and software projects developed by the lab, with links to their respective GitHub repositories.
*   **About (`about.html`):** Contains information about the lab's mission, research interests, and team.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **Tailwind CSS** (for styling, loaded via CDN)
*   **Font Awesome** (for icons, loaded via CDN)
*   **JavaScript** (for basic interactivity like mobile menu and dynamic content)
